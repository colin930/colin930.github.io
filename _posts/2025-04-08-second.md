## RTL-to-GDS Flow: A Closer Look

Most RTL-to-GDS flow diagrams you see online are pretty simplified, so I made one with a bit more detail—closer to what design engineers actually work with in real projects. It reflects the kind of tasks we deal with day to day, not just the basic textbook version.

I did include Physical Design in the flow, but didn’t go into the details yet. Since that’s the part I mainly work on, I’m planning to cover the full PD flow in a separate post. The overall structure of PD is already quite standardized, but the real flows we use at work are much more complex. There are plenty of custom scripts that run before and after the main EDA tool commands to help everything tie together and run smoothly.

That goes for other parts too—like synthesis, DFT, and verification. These stages also use a lot of automated scripts, usually written in `.tcl`, to manage and connect each step of the flow.

In the next post, I’ll walk through the Physical Design flow and give a simple overview of how it works in practice.
